## Template
Two-phase translation leads to an important problem in the handling of templates in practice: When a function template is used in a way that triggers its instantiation, a compiler will (at some point) need to see that templateâ€™s definition. This breaks the usual compile and link distinction for ordinary functions, when the declaration of a function is sufficient to compile its use. One simple way to resolve this is to implement each template inside a header file.
